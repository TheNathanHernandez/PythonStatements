print('Welcome to Python!')
# Output: Welcome to Python
# Why: String says "Welcome to Python

print(1+1)
# Output: 2
# Why: Math sum / 1 + 1 = 2

# print(This will produce an error)
# Output: This will produce an Error
# Why: The text doesn't have a string, it's invalid

print(5+5-2)
# Output: 8
# Why: 5 + 5 - 2

print(3*3+1)
# Output: 10
# Why: 3 x 3 + 1

print(10+3*2)
# Output: 16
# Why: 10 + 3 x 2

print((10 + 3) *2)
# Output: 26
# Why: 10 + 3 x 2

print(10/5)
# Output: 2
# Why: 10 divided by 5

print(5<6)
# Output: True
# Why: 6 is greater than 5. So, the Boolean statement is true.

print(5>6)
# Output: False
# Why: 5 is not over 6. So, the Boolean statement is false.

print(3==3)
# Output: True
# Why: 3 is the same as 3. So, the Boolean statement is true.

print(3==4)
# Output: False
# Why: 3 is not the same as 4. So, the Boolean statement is false.

print(4!=4)
# Output: False
# Why: != < means not equal. But 4 is equal to 4. So, the Boolean statement is false.

print("The secret number is", 23)
# Output: The secret number is 23
# Why: The print statement said it in a string with a number.
print("The secret number is",23)
# Output: The secret number is 23
# Why: The print statement said it in a string with a number.
print("The sum is ",(5+2))
# Output: The sum is 7
# Why: "The sum is" after that, a mathematical statement was added. Which equalled 7.
